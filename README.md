# Mate Protocol

Mate is based on a Project Ownership Share Protocol (POSP) that utilizes smart contracts on the Solana blockchain to manage the distribution of ownership shares and revenue.

The goal is to decentralize project ownership to enhance work independence.

Performance is a team job. Try the demo and share your thoughts.

## Project Ownership Share Protocol

Decentralizing project ownership refers to distributing decision-making authority and responsibility among team members, rather than having a single person or group in control. This approach aims to give team members more autonomy and ownership over their work, which in turn enhances their sense of independence and motivation.

By decentralizing project ownership, team members can take ownership of specific tasks and manage them independently, rather than relying on a single leader or manager to make decisions. This allows team members to take initiative, make decisions and take responsibility for their own work. Additionally, it can improve communication and collaboration among team members and increase overall productivity and job satisfaction.

In summary, the goal of decentralizing project ownership is to empower team members to take control of their own work, and to increase their independence, motivation and productivity.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
